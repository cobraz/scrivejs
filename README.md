Use this to integrate with the [Scrive API][scrive-docs].

**Note**: Don't expect full coverage for the API, as there is no code generating
involved; we add features as we go. Contributions are very welcome!

## Features

- ‚úÖ Great test coverage
- üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Inline documentation
- üîí Runtime type-checking

## Documentation

To get started, install the NPM package.

```shell
yarn add scrive-sdk
```

Let's look at an example where we are creating a new document based on a
template.

**Tip**: In the Scrive UI, you'll find the ID as the numeric value in the URL.
Let's say the URL to the document is `https://scrive.com/d/9222321123123`, then
the ID is `9222321123123

```typescript
import { ScriveSdk } from 'scrive-sdk';

const client = ScriveSdk.usePersonalAccessCredentials({
  apitoken: 'something',
  accesstoken: 'is-something',
  apisecret: 'when-there-nothing',
  accesssecret: 'here',
});

client.prepare().newDocumentFromTemplate('9222321123123');
```

The SDK provides a way to construct the SDK class based on which way you are
going to authenticate with the API. For now, we only support _personal access
credentails_ as shown above, but I imagine this will look very similar once
OAuth is added too.
